                        led migration from v2 to v3 risk model for 1m user overdraft program ($60m exposure). backtesting revealed v3 was just a more conservative version of v2—no actual improvement in risk separation. pivoted to building custom segmentation that captured credit-neediness signals both models missed.
                        <br><br>
                        the real work was rebinning analysis. tested which declined users were actually low-risk and where score cutoffs left opportunity on the table. found credit-neediness wasn't linear—middle risk bands were more sensitive to timing and cash flow volatility than absolute balance levels.
                        <br><br>
                        built a framework for comparing model populations using actual user cohorts rather than aggregate metrics. still use it for evaluating new risk models.

                        built credit policy from scratch for new cash advance product with zero historical data. backtested every behavioral and balance signal using overdraft data—transaction frequency, deposit consistency, account tenure, nsf history—to see what actually split risk.
                        <br><br>
                        settled on 3-tier segmentation through systematic testing. users who managed overdraft well mostly managed advances well. balance volatility didn't predict default. overdraft limits worked as proxy for behavior but broke down for balances. built in systematic review points to compare actual performance to predictions and adjust rules.
                        <br><br>
                        treated the policy as a learning system. higher overdraft users were actually less likely to default on advances—forced a policy rewrite three months in. every cohort became a test of our assumptions.

                        built system to predict when 400k users would receive their next paycheck. direct deposit timestamps were messy—timezone issues, weekend delays, early/late payments, no reliable ground truth for pay schedules.
                        <br><br>
                        started simple: calculate historical cadence, use last payday, predict forward. worked for 60% of users with clean schedules. the other 40% were edge cases requiring different logic—holidays shifting dates, gig workers with irregular schedules, semi-monthly vs. biweekly confusion, job switchers.
                        <br><br>
                        built classification system to identify irregular patterns, then separate prediction logic for each type. gig workers needed rolling averages. semi-monthly employees needed calendar-based logic. job switchers needed reset mechanisms. got to 98% accuracy by embracing the messiness rather than forcing a unified framework.

                        led transition of store-only cardholders to updated cobrand with spend-anywhere capability. existing cardholders were riskier (selected for store-only product, lower engagement), but product expansion could improve retention.

                        developed segmentation to identify who could safely receive broader spending power. tested risk signals—payment history, utilization, tenure—to predict who'd maintain good standing. found engagement patterns were more predictive than credit behavior. active store card users, even with higher utilization, were safer bets than low-utilization cardholders.

                        evaluated new fraud model using swap-in/swap-out analysis—compared credit performance of approvals under new vs. old model to quantify impact before implementation. rather than score distributions or approval rates, compared actual populations of approved applicants to see how risk profiles would change.
                        <br><br>
                        segmented applicants into "approved by both," "approved only by old," "approved only by new." the last two showed where models disagreed and let us estimate portfolio impact. new model caught fraud patterns the old missed but was more conservative on legitimate applicants in certain segments.
                        <br><br>
                        built monitoring framework to validate predictions post-rollout. became template for future model validations—comparing actual approval populations was far more predictive than hypothetical score distributions.
