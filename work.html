                        led migration from v2 to v3 risk model for 1m user overdraft program ($60m exposure). conducted
                        extensive backtesting to identify pockets of low-risk users who could receive higher limits,
                        expanding program reach while maintaining portfolio health. discovered through analysis that v3
                        was essentially a scaled-down version of v2, leading to development of custom rebinning solutions
                        that better captured credit-neediness signals. result: 23% reduction in loss rates ($1.5m annually)
                        and 20% decrease in customer complaints through more accurate limit assignments.
